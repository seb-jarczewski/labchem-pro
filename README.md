# LabChem PRO

Labchem PRO is a web app laboratory inventory management system, based on my Labchem-db preliminary project. 

The project is currently **in development phase**, constantly improved.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install requirements from `requirements.txt`.
3. Run the development server.

The home page shows welcome screen with access to the main table in read only mode for not logged in users.
Currently, only Reagent table is available - the chemical reagents inventory table.

Information you can store in the record:
- Unique ID
- Name
- CAS no.
- Capacity
- Unit
- Manufaturer
- Location in lab
- Added on

You can login to get access to edit mode!

  You can delete any record by clicking üóëÔ∏è.

  You can edit any record by clicking ‚úèÔ∏è.

  You can find any reagent by choosing ctrl+f.

Logged in users can add new users to the User table and new reagents to the Reagent table.

Passwords are stored as hashes.

## Improvements planned to be implemented in the near future:

- adding, editing and deleting users restricted only to Admin user,
- reset passwords by users,
- adding new, customized tables,
